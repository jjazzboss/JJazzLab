* Variations: 2 feel (2 variations LACoolSwing-B1, JazzClub.S120-B1) ? check out Shuffle rhythm examples), walking, walking double notes (C C Bb Bb etc.) see JazzClub.S120-C
* Handle slash chords
* Create the AdaptedRhythm
* Handle pedal notes in walking or 1 out of 2
* Handle RP intensity
* Handle anticipated chords
* Scorer, reject wbpsources with out of scale long notes at slow tempos
* Adjust notes length and shift depending on tempo and 2-feel or 4-feel
* Authorize WbpSources in the DB with non-root/chord-tone start/end notes => managed by Scorer. If last note is a semitone approach note to target note, mark it, so it can only be used with the right target note.
* Database: harmonize phrases velocity
* Test minor chords with scale 


MAYBE LATER
* Generator: if a WbpSource is used twice, alter its "groove" (positions+velocity) by copying a similar phrase groove
* Generate alternate phrases from DB: try symetric patterns ?
* Scorer: take into account start/end slopes matching ?
* Programmatically add embellishments like p15 (for 2 feel), p28 of Constructing-walking-pdf...
* Try to automatically assign a chord scale to chords (DB and song)
* Handle the tags to select WbpSources
* Do not directly disable duplicates: they provide velocity/timing variety. Check should be done by Scorer vs Tiling ? 


BUGS
* Save as default rhythm file with "/" in proswin 4/4
* test with 2 chords
* Exception when using play loop zone in some cases
