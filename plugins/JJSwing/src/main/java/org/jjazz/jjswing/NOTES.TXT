What a “swing ratio” is

    Think of one beat divided into two 8th notes: “DA-da”.

    A 2:1 swing ratio means: the first 8th lasts twice as long as the second one (like a triplet “quarter + 8th”: long–short).

    A 3:1 ratio means the first is three times longer than the second (very lopsided long–short).

    A 1:1 ratio is straight 8ths (both exactly the same length).

So “2.6–3.0:1” means very “triplet‑y”, strongly swung; “1.4–1.7:1” is only mildly long–short, closer to straight.
How this changes with tempo

Empirical measurements show that jazz players naturally change this ratio with tempo:

    Slow tempos: Swing ratio often around 2.6–3.0:1.

        First 8th is much longer, second is short and late → very clear “long–short” feel.

    Bright / fast tempos: Swing ratio tends to compress to about 1.4–1.7:1.

        The offbeat is only a bit late; the two 8ths are more similar in length so the line doesn’t feel clumsy or rushed.

“Map … from 2.6–3.0:1 at slow tempos toward 1.4–1.7:1 at bright tempos” means:

    Define a function of BPM → swing ratio, which:

        Outputs ~2.6–3.0 when BPM is low.

        Decreases smoothly as BPM increases.

        Reaches ~1.4–1.7 when BPM is high (and optionally approaches 1.0 at very high BPM).

In JJazzLab terms: when generating swung 8ths, compute the duration of the first vs second 8th in each beat using a tempo‑dependent ratio instead of a fixed “triplet swing.”

---------

Here are pragmatic, tempo-aware rules you can apply to JJazzLab’s generated walking bass to keep it musical and consistent across tempos. Values are ranges; expose them as tunable parameters.

## Timing grid and swing ratio
- Use a tempo-dependent swing ratio curve. Map swung 8ths from about 2.6–3.0:1 at slow tempos toward 1.4–1.7:1 at bright tempos; clamp to ~1.0–1.2:1 above very fast tempos so lines don’t lurch. Smoothly interpolate per BPM. This reflects the well-documented decrease of swing ratio with increasing tempo.[1][2]
- Keep microtiming subtle. If you add humanization, cap systematic ahead/behind offsets per note to ±5–10 ms at medium–fast tempos and ±10–20 ms at slow tempos. Excess or inverted microtiming tends to reduce perceived swing; many studies find that stable or lightly quantized timing can rate as more “swinging.”[3][4][5]
- Preserve downbeat clarity. If modeling downbeat delay, keep it tiny (≤10 ms) and scale it down as tempo rises; larger downbeat delays harm tightness at high BPM.[4]
That phrase is about how far the offbeat 8th note is delayed relative to the downbeat 8th, and how this delay depends on tempo.



## Note onset placement by tempo
- Slow/medium tempos (< ~160 BPM): Allow a slight “laid back” onset tendency (0 to +8 ms behind grid) on beats 1 and 3, and near‑center on 2 and 4; this yields relaxed propulsion.[3][4]
- Bright tempos (≥ ~160–190 BPM): Reduce deviations and permit a mild forward lean (−3 to −8 ms) on quarter notes, especially on approach tones, to avoid sagging while not changing tempo. Keep the ride/hi‑hat proxy centered; only the bass leans a touch.[5]

## Velocity dynamics and articulation
- Quarter‑note envelope. Use slightly stronger velocity on beats 1 and 3 than 2 and 4 at slow/medium tempos (e.g., +4 to +8 MIDI velocity), then flatten this contrast with tempo so fast walking stays even and non-punchy. Consistent pulse and predictability support stronger swing ratings.[4][5]
- De‑accent long notes at high BPM. Above ~200 BPM, shorten note lengths a bit (e.g., 85–92% gate) and reduce peak velocity 2–4 points to prevent buildup and rushing; rely on sustain rather than attack for propulsion.[5]
- Dynamic range scaling. Narrow overall velocity variance as tempo increases (e.g., standard deviation 10–14 at slow, 6–8 at fast) to keep lines smooth and reduce fatigue.[4]

## Duration and legato
- Legato by tempo. At slow/medium tempos target legato 95–100% gate with slight releases before chord changes; at fast tempos reduce to ~88–94% to improve clarity and articulation without sounding staccato. This helps stability when subdivisions get dense.[3][5]
- Approach-note shortening. Chromatic approaches can be 5–10% shorter than chord tones at high BPM to keep the quarter-note grid clear.[3]

## Humanization model
- Random jitter small and tempo-scaled. If adding random timing jitter, use zero-mean Gaussian with SD ~4–7 ms slow, ~2–4 ms fast, and hard-limit to ±12 ms; apply even less on strong beats. Studies show excessive deviation reduces swing/groove; “just enough” variation avoids mechanical feel.[5][4]

## Density, accents, and form support
- Higher density → smaller deviations. When the pattern uses passing tones/anticipations, proportionally reduce timing offsets so inter-onset deviations remain small relative to IOI (~2–5% guideline). Denser lines tolerate less absolute shift.[6][5]
- Cadential landings on-grid. For barlines and key cadences (beat 1 of new section), snap onset closer to grid than surrounding notes to reinforce form at all tempos. Predictable anchors boost perceived groove.[4]

## Safety defaults and tunables
- Provide three presets per tempo: Relaxed, Neutral, Driving. These scale swing ratio, onset lean, and velocity contrast by fixed multipliers while honoring the tempo curves above.[2][4]
- Expose controls: swing ratio curve, max systematic offset, random jitter SD, legato %, beat‑accent deltas, and “forward lean” at fast tempos. Document recommended ranges per BPM.[1][4]

These rules align with empirical findings: swing ratios compress with tempo; stable, predictable timing often outperforms exaggerated microtiming for perceived swing; and any expressive offsets should be small, tempo-scaled, and musically anchored to the bar structure.[2][1][4]

-----

Many rules overlap between bass and drums because both anchor the groove in jazz swing, but there are key differences in how microtiming, velocity, and articulation should be treated for drums versus bass.

## Shared rules to apply to drums

- **Tempo-dependent swing ratio compression**: Like bass, ride cymbal and hi-hat swung 8ths tighten as tempo increases, moving from large long–short ratios at slow tempos to nearly straight at fast tempos to maintain clarity and drive.[1][2]
- **Scaling microtiming deviations**: Keep timing offsets (ahead/behind beat) small and decrease their magnitude as tempo rises, typically ±5 ms or less at high BPM to avoid dragging or sloppiness. This supports consistent swing feel without losing pulse stability.[1]
- **Velocity dynamic narrowing with tempo**: At faster tempos, reduce dynamic contrast and peak velocities slightly to preserve clarity and prevent fatigue; at slower tempos, allow more accented ride or snare hits for expressive swing phrasing.[2]
- **Maintain strong downbeat clarity**: Keep the downbeat (beat 1) well-defined and relatively on-grid to anchor measures, especially in hi-hat “chick” and bass drum timing.[1]

## Drum-specific differences

- **Snare drum microtiming is more variable**: Unlike bass, which often locks closely to pulse, snare “backbeat” hit placement can fluctuate more (a few ms ahead or behind) to add groove tension and release. Avoid rigid timing; small intentional shifts can enhance swing.[3][2]
- **Ride cymbal often stays more centered**: The ride cymbal pattern usually acts as the primary timekeeper and should remain closest to the metronomic grid to give the band a steady pulse reference. Bass and snare can shift relative to it.[2]
- **Articulation variety helps swing perception**: For drums, use subtle variations in stick attack velocity and note length (e.g., slightly shorter cymbal notes at fast tempos) to add texture without blurring time or volume peaks as you would for bass sustain.[2]
- **Ghost notes and subdivisions vary by tempo**: At slow tempos, allow more ghost notes with more variable timing and velocity; at fast tempos, tighten these to maintain density without cluttering.[4]

## Summary

When adapting your JJazzLab drum track:

- Apply swing ratio scaling, microtiming reduction, velocity compression, and pulse anchoring rules much like bass.  
- Keep ride cymbal timing consistent and near the beat.  
- Allow more flexible snare microtiming and articulation shifts to enhance groove.  
- Adjust ghost note timing and velocity dynamically with the tempo.

So the core tempo-dependent microtiming and dynamics principles generalize, but the expressive timing and articulation specifics differ between bass and drums to match their musical roles.
