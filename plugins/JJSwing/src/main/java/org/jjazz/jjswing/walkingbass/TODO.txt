* Variations: Drums shuffle with walking bass "a la" Twisted/Joni Mitchel 
* Variations: 2-feel but walking ? listent to swan lake hubert laws 3:30
* Scorer, reject wbpsources with out of scale long notes at slow tempos
* FInalize rhythm dialog settings
* Automate rhythm tests on 2000 sngs
* Do tests with multiple rhythms/time signatures, play from start, middle, loop selection
* Reuse WbpsaStore between calls (save all the Wbpsas with score > 0), so they can be later quickly recheked with standard score tester
* rule that if one dimension of a Score is 0 then overall Score is 0.
* Profile music generation for optimization
* Review all Midi notes to make sure note length is long enough (spotted too short notes in walking)



BUGS



MAYBE LATER
* Generator: if a WbpSource is used twice, alter its "groove" (positions+velocity) by copying a similar phrase groove
* Generate alternate phrases from DB: try symetric patterns ?
* Scorer: take into account start/end slopes matching ?
* Programmatically add embellishments like p15 (for 2 feel), p28 of Constructing-walking-pdf...
* Try to automatically assign a chord scale to chords (DB and song)
* Handle the tags to select WbpSources
* Post-process to avoid same note from bar x == first note from bar x+1. Already managed at WbpSource scoring level, but still 
it can happen, and  it can also happen after tiling because of pedal bass handling
* Do not directly disable duplicates: they provide velocity/timing variety. Check should be done by Scorer vs Tiling ?
