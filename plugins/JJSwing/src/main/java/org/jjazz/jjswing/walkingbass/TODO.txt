* Variations: Walking double notes (C C Bb Bb etc. reuse walking bass line to get contour), Drums shuffle with walking bass "a la" Twisted/Joni Mitchel 
* Variations: 2-feel but walking ? listent to swan lake hubert laws 3:30
* Scorer, reject wbpsources with out of scale long notes at slow tempos
* Database: harmonize phrases velocity
* FInalize rhythm dialog settings
* Automate rhythm tests on 2000 sngs
* Do tests with multiple rhythms/time signatures, play from start, middle, loop selection
* Reuse WbpsaStore between calls (save all the Wbpsas with score > 0), so they can be later quickly recheked with standard score tester
* Implement hold/shot for notes custom for NON std chord positions 
* rule that if one dimension of a Score is 0 then overall Score is 0.
* Profile music generation for optimization
* Discard 1-bar (and 2-bar?) WbpSources which are natively too off transposition: ex RedsHead#fr=45#sz=1 (at least 1 octave too high)
* TEST ROUNDMIDNIGHT many untiled bars on whole songs, but disappear when song is made smaller ?? bug chordsequence equals need chordleadsheet to support equals normally


MAYBE LATER
* Generator: if a WbpSource is used twice, alter its "groove" (positions+velocity) by copying a similar phrase groove
* Generate alternate phrases from DB: try symetric patterns ?
* Scorer: take into account start/end slopes matching ?
* Programmatically add embellishments like p15 (for 2 feel), p28 of Constructing-walking-pdf...
* Try to automatically assign a chord scale to chords (DB and song)
* Handle the tags to select WbpSources
* Post-process to avoid same note from bar x == first note from bar x+1. Already managed at WbpSource scoring level, but still 
it can happen, and  it can also happen after tiling because of pedal bass handling
* Do not directly disable duplicates: they provide velocity/timing variety. Check should be done by Scorer vs Tiling ? 


BUGS
* Exception when using play loop zone in some cases
