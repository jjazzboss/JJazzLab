Netbeans Internationalization INFO

I18N wizard Format to use (it's often reset if string has some args or not, so need to copy & paste): 
ResUtil.getString(getClass(),"{key}", {arguments})

Convenient regex to be used To be used post I18N wizard (the simple file-by-file one)
(CTL_\w+)\(\)  =>   ResUtil.getString(getClass(), "$1")
(ERR_\w+)\(\)  =>   ResUtil.getString(getClass(), "$1")
, new Object[] {}  => ""
, new Object\[\] \{(\w+)\}  =>  ", $1"

Check Bundle.properties:
- replace ' by 2 single quotes ''
- replace \\n by \n

Tips: 
- "(?<!')'(?!')" regex to search for single occurences of '

USE  NbBundle.getMessage() and localize-ready Netbeans utilities  => PROBLEM READS ONLY ISO!!
http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqNbIdiosyncracies
NB: ImageUtilities.loadImage() can handle localized image (change file name), see https://www.slideshare.net/eppleton/branding-internationalization-with-the-netbeans-platform

HOW TO LOCALIZE NETBEANS STANDARD MENU ITEMS LIKE MAIN MENUBAR "FILE" ?
=> Use JJazzLab Branding 
Find the resource bundle which defines the action: 
- Go to JJazzLab branding, Internatation resources, select french (to create the first one), search "File" entry, get name of corresponding resource bundle.  
- Go to Internationalization bundle, locate resource bundle above, add an entry different for File, File=Fichier
=> this creates a Bundle_fr_FR.properties with the entry in jjazzlab/branding/modules/jar_name/path
=> duplicate the bundle for each other language Bundle_de_XX.properties 

Info: It seems that the Netbeans-declared layer folders use attribute "SystemFileSystem.localizingBundle" to make the item localizable via branding
<folder name="Platforms">
            <attr name="SystemFileSystem.localizingBundle" stringvalue="org.netbeans.modules.java.platform.resources.Bundle"/>


------------------
HOW TO LOCALIZE MY OWN LAYER.XML FOLDERS, which sometimes appeart in UI ?
Like for the MixConsole menubar which is constructed from layer.xml folders found in "MixConsole/MenuBar",  so "File" folder translates to File menu title. So how to change "File"?
Edit the layer.xml file which defines the MixConsole/MenuBar/File
Select File, righ-click Localize, Type "FileInEnglish"  translation. 
=> this adds the displayName attribute to the layer.xml folder + add an entry <module_path>/File=FileInEnglish in Bundle.properties
=> copy and add the entry in Bundle_fr <module_path>/File=FichierEnFrancais


----------------------
.properties by default are NOT saved under UTF8 encoding, use ISO-8859-1! 
So problem when reusing them from crowdin which stores them in UTF8
As a workaround there is the possibility to change the encoding used by NB file by file (select .properties, right-click properties, check "use project encoding" which is UTF8.)
But where is this information stored!? ==> need to manually change it if creating a new .properties

=> Created SetProjectEncodingPlugin <===========
IMPORTANT: each time a new .properties is created, select the project, menu Edit, "Use Project Encoding on all properties"



My EMAIL USERS@NETBEANRS.ORG
> Well since unfortunately the encoding of a property file is set as ISO-8859-1 in it spec,
At least for JDK 11 the API says the opposite : https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html, see the API paragraph.
And indeed it's what I experiment: if I use ResourceBundle.getBundle(Class, Module),getString(key), it does automatically read UTF-8 or ISO strings (I made a test with both encodings in a single.properties file).
If I use NbBundle.getMessage() then it always expects ISO, that's why I don't use it. The problem is that I can't alter the behavior of the Netbeans internal stuff which still works the "old way". This impacts branding localization or action displayname declared via @ActionRegistration(lazy=true).

I posted a JIRA enhancement request

Tested an Ant patch (-post-compile extension point) to automatically apply native2ascii on copied resource bundles before they got put in jar. Works OK for modules. 
See MyRCPapp(common_module)+module4(build.xml)+shell UTF8toISO8859.sh. But still problem for reencoding branding localization bundles, no easy way to patch the build script!
See question on NB user devlist (no answer...).

The patch which introduced the possibility to alter encoding file by file
http://hg.netbeans.org/core-main/rev/f32f64dd4a38
+ file.getAttribute(PropertiesDataNode.PROPERTY_ENCODING); => if true it will use project encoding (UTF8), otherwise it uses the default ISO-8859-1
+        if (attribute != null) {
+            boolean useProjectEncoding = (Boolean) attribute;
