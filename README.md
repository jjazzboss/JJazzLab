# JJazzLab

JJazzLab is a complete and open application dedicated to backing tracks generation. You type in chord symbols, select a rhythm (style), then the application generates a complete backing track with drums, bass, guitar, piano, strings, etc. 

The objective is to generate **intelligent and interesting backing tracks**, i.e tracks which are: 
- realistic
- non-boring (with variations)
- easily customizable, even for complex songs

*The JJazzLab UI (available in several languages English, German, French, Chinese, Portuguese, etc thanks to the JJazzLab community):*

From version 4.0 JJazzLab embeds its own customized software synth based on [FluidSynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/). For even better sounds, just connect JJazzLab to VST plugins via a virtual Midi cable and a VST host.

## An open architecture

JJazzLab is based on the [Apache Netbeans Platform](https://netbeans.org/features/platform/features.html) which provides a reliable and extensible application architecture via plugins.

Developers can easily add music generation capabilities or try new ideas, without taking care of all the "plumbing".

## JJazzLab Toolkit

The [JJazzLab Toolkit](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLabToolkit)  is a single standalone jar (all dependencies are included) which contains the JJazzLab core (no GUI).

It makes it easy to experiment with JJazzLab models and algorithms, or create your own plugins.
