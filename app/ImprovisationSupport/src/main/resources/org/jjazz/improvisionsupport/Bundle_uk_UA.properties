DenseSparse1DisplayName=Dense/Sparse exercise - Level 1
DenseSparseHelpText=This is a Play/Rest exercise variant from Hal Crook's "How to improvise" reference book.\n\n"Like pacing and phrase lengths, rhythmic density is an extremely noticeable aspect of improvising."\n\n"A 'dense' phrase means the activity sounds busy or complex, usually with many short notes. A 'sparse' phrase means the activity sounds relatively un-busy and simple, usually with fewer/longer notes."\n\n"The objective is to become familiar with controlling and balancing the quantity of notes played in each phrase to create variety and interest."

PlayRestHelpText=This is a fundamental exercise from Hal Crook's "How to improvise" reference book. It's not so difficult though it's very effective to help you build more interesting solos.\n\n"It creates opportunities to exercise and maintain control over the direction of the solo, which can easily be lost when you play continuously."\n\n"During each rest period, listen for the echo of the previous idea in your mind's ear. Initially, you might think that you are resting too much, that it doesn't seem like you are really improvising unless you're playing all the time. Try to become equally comfortable with playing and resting. Treat it like an experiment and see what happens."
