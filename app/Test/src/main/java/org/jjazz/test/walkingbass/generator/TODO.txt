* Variations: 2 feel (2 variations LACoolSwing-B1, JazzClub.S120-B1) ? check out Shuffle rhythm examples), walking, walking double notes (C C Bb Bb etc.)
* Programmatically add embellishments like p15 (for 2 feel), p28 of Constructig-walking-pdf...
* Handle slow / medium / fast tempo
* Handle pedal notes in walking or 1 out of 2
* Generate alternate phrases from DB: some simple phrases are compatible C and Cm, duplicate the WBpSource with the other chord so phrase becomes available for both chord types
* Generator: if a WbpSource is used twice, alter its "groove" (positions+velocity) by copying a similar phrase groove
* Try to automatically assign a chord scale to chords (DB and song)
* Handle non recognized multi-chord bars
* Handle RP intensity
* Handle non standard chords positioning & anticipated chords: handle 3 chords/bar case. For complex case play one beat per chord (reuse groove pos/vel)
* Scorer: take into account start/end slopes matching ?
* Database: harmonize phrases velocity ?
* Generate alternate phrases from DB: try symetric patterns ?
* Do not use WBpSources with crossing notes at boundaries
* reject wbpsources with out of scale long notes at slow tempos
* weighted duration calculation: don't count last note if half-tone up/sub next chord => it's a transition note
* Make quarter notes duratino shorter with high tempo
* Check consistency: search for 2-chord bars root profiles with 0 or just 1 WbpSource
