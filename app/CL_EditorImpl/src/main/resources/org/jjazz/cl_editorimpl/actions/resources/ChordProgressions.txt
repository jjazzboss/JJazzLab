// JJAZZLAB USER CHORD PROGRESSIONS FILE
//
// The chord progressions found in this file are used by the 'Insert->Chord progressions' entry in the bar popupmenu of 
// the chord leadsheet editor (when you right-click on a bar). 
// 
// You can customize it as you wish.
//
// When a chord progression is inserted via Insert->Chord progression, all its chords are automatically selected so they can be 
// easily transposed (using the mouse-wheel on a chord, or ctrl-UP/DOWN).
//
// FORMAT:
// - Empty lines are ignored
// - Each chord progression uses 1 line and must start and end with the '|' char
// - Max 2 chords per bar
// - The '%' char is supported: '|Cm7 F7 | % |' means '|Cm7 F7 |Cm7 F7 |'
// 
// CATEGORIES:
// - Other lines are categories used to group chord progressions
// - Each category or subcategory is shown as a submenu in the bar's popup menu
// - Subcategories can be created using "--" between a parent category and a subcategory. Example:  "Blues -- Major", "Blues -- Minor"
// - You can define several levels of subcategories, e.g. "blues -- major -- basic", "blues -- major -- jazz"
